asn1 module for Qore
version 0.0.1 by David Nichols

Requires qore 0.7.0 and openssl headers and libraries to build.

Documentation in docs/asn1-module-doc.html (using TiddlyWiki)

This initial version of the asn1 module only supports a subset of ASN.1 data types, in fact, only enough to create and parse RFC3161 timestamp requests and responses.
It should be fairly easy to add support for more ASN.1 data types and functionality in the future though.

test/example script: test-asn1.q
